# Moilapp Plugin - VTF

## Video to Sequence of Frames Converter

### Description

This is a Moilapp Plugin that can be used to create a sequence of frames based on the given video file into the uploaded directory within the plugin, and you can specify whether to collect for N-frames per second (which is initialized at 10 frames by default). While you're at it, once you hit the `Convert` button on the shown menu, you will be presented by sequence of frames being played while converting the video into images simultaneously.

## Notice on Use

We highly recommend not to do anything foolish while the program is trying to convert the video into sequence of images, because it will became pretty laggy at some point, so stay still until the conversion process is done.

## Further Update

1. `Cancel` button is not responding properly.
2. Let the user specify for the custom saving directory for the converted images.
3. Make the `VideoLabelOutput` label available for video playing *(if possible)*
4. Handle more issues when it came by at some point.
